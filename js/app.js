// Uses a method of that object to generate a random number of customers per hour. Objects/Math/random

// Calculate and store the simulated amounts of cookies purchased for each hour at each location using average cookies purchased and the random number of customers generated

// Store the results for each location in a separate arrayâ€¦ perhaps as a property of the object representing that location

// Display the values of each array as unordered lists in the browser

// Calculating the sum of these hourly totals; your output for each location should look like this:
